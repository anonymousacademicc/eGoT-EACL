Answer 2, while accurate, provides a more linear narrative and omits many of these details, making it less exhaustive."}, "Empowerment": {"Winner": "Answer 1", "Explanation": "Empowerment is about giving the reader the tools to form an informed judgment. Answer 1 does this by breaking the topic into discrete sections, presenting concrete facts (dates, vote counts, tribunal findings), offering multiple expert perspectives, and even summarising key take‑aways and an actionable insight. This structure helps readers see cause‑and‑effect relationships and evaluate Haughey’s legacy. Answer 2 tells a coherent story but offers fewer concrete data points and less analytical framing, giving the reader less material for independent assessment."}, "Diversity": {"Winner": "Answer 1", "Explanation": "Diversity refers to the range of viewpoints and types of information presented. Answer 1 includes political, legal, policy, personal‑reputation, and historiographical dimensions, quoting three different historians and linking the crisis to later events such as the Moriarty Tribunal.
