{"Comprehensiveness": {"Winner": "Answer 2", "Explanation": "Answer 2 not only restates Miss Vane’s view that a woman’s status depends on the rank of her male relatives, but it also adds contextual information about her brother’s influence, a specific example of a higher‑ranking lady, the narrator’s critique, and a comparison with attitudes in Bangor, Maine. This broader set of details covers more facets of the topic than Answer 1, which stays limited to a brief summary and a few implications."}, "Empowerment": {"Winner": "Answer 2", "Explanation": "Empowerment is about helping the reader form an informed judgment. Answer 2 provides the raw description, shows how Miss Vane internalizes patriarchal norms, and then presents a contrasting viewpoint from the narrator. By exposing the reader to both the described position and a critical perspective, it equips the reader to evaluate the fairness of those norms more fully than Answer 1, which offers only a straightforward description without any counter‑argument."}, "Diversity": {"Winner": "Answer 2", "Explanation": "Diversity measures the range of perspectives offered. Answer 2 includes multiple voices: Miss Vane’s own statement, the influence of her brother, the narrator’s opposing view, and even a cross‑cultural comparison. Answer 1 presents a single, homogeneous perspective, so Answer 2 is more diverse."}, "Overall Winner": {"Winner": "Answer 2", "Explanation": "Answer 2 wins in all three evaluated categories.
