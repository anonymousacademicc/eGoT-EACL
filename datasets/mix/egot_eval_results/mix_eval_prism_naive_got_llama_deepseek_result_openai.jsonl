Answer 2 is descriptive only and does not give the reader concrete steps to act on the information."}, "Diversity": {"Winner": "Answer 1", "Explanation": "Answer 1 presents a wide range of perspectives: methodological design, technical implementation, analytical findings, limitations, and real‑world uses. It integrates several analytical lenses (semantic shifts, sentiment, gender correlation) and multiple toolchains. Answer 2 focuses on three related aspects (top‑ranked words, embeddings, emotional orientation) and therefore offers a narrower view."}, "Overall Winner": {"Winner": "Answer 1", "Explanation": "Across all three evaluation criteria—Comprehensiveness, Empowerment, and Diversity—Answer 1 consistently provides more detail, broader insight, and practical guidance, making it the superior response to the question about how the study qualitatively analyzes industry language."}}
